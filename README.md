#Theater Time

Theater Time is an app to automate the Theater mode found in Android Wear wearables. You can turn on/off Theater mode from your phone and use a timer to set up rules for when you go to sleep/work... to help save battery and distraction.

**NOTE: The watch needs to be rooted** in order for the app to work, you can find root guides for your watch on XDA.
